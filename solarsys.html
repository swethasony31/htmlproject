            <h2> <u>  Introduction to the Solar System: </u> </h2>
The Sun and the celestial bodies combining is known as the solar system. The sun is located at the centre, and all the planets revolve around it. There are eight planets in our solar system, along with a host of asteroids, comets, and meteors. The gravitational attraction between the sun and the celestial bodies maintains the revolving of these planets around the sun.

Like stars, planets are also celestial bodies; however, they are enlightened by the sun because they do not produce their own light. The solar system consists of eight planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the planets in ascending order from the distance of the Sun.<br>
Note: Pluto used to be counted as a planet till 2006. It was located at the farthest distance from the sun. Then in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a new definition of a planet in which Pluto does not fit. So, it is now eliminated from the solar family.
<br> 
<h2> <u>The Sun </u></h2>
It is a star that is nearest to us. It is the largest source of the emission of light and heat. Furthermore, it gives its light to all the planets revolving around it. It seems to rise in the east and set in the west as the earth rotates from the west to the east
<br> 

<h2> <u> The Planets </u> </h2>
Planets look just like stars, but they do not have their own lights as the stars.
 <br> 
They continuously change their positions with respect to the stars<br>
A planet revolves around the sun in a definite path, which is known as orbit<br>
The time duration in which a planet completes its one revolution is known as the period of revolution. It increases as the distance of the planet increases from the Sun<br>
Besides revolving, the planets rotate on their axis too. The time duration in which a planet completes its one rotation is known as the period of rotatio<br>
Some planets are known to have moons/satellites revolving around them. Any celestial body revolving around another celestial body is called its satellite. Usually, the term satellite is used for the bodies revolving around planets. e.g., the moon is a satellite of the Earth
There are also artificial satellites revolving around the Earth. These are called artificial satellites.<br>

<strong> <u> Planet Groups </u></strong>
Planets can be divided into two groups:<br>
Inner Planets: It comprises the first four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are much nearer the Sun than the other four planets. These have very few moons.<br>
Outer Planets: It comprises planets outside the orbit of Mars – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These are much farther off than the inner planets. They have many moons.<br><br>

<b><strong><u> Conclusion </u></strong> </b>
    You’ve probably heard that there are a number of artificial satellites orbiting the Earth. You may be wondering how artificial satellites differ from natural satellites. Artificial satellites are created by humans. They are launched from the Earth’s surface. They orbit the Earth much closer than the moon, the Earth’s natural satellite.<br>
    Several artificial satellites have been built and launched by India. The first Indian satellite was Aryabhata. Other Indian satellites include INSAT, IRS, Kalpana-1, EDU SAT, and others.<br>
    Artificial satellites have a wide range of applications. They are used for weather forecasting as well as transmitting television and radio signals. They are also used in communications and remote sensing.
